# General Example Specs

This file should contain the main specs for your component or item.

If  this project contains multiple components, please organize this project with subfolders named appropriately for each component. 

Then within those folders, please include the standard spec files:
- general-specs.md
- visual-specs.md

## If your component or project has specific specs for these topics, please create the appropriate files at this level in your directory.
- colors.md (Ideally you should be using the BYU Colors. If there are specific needs for additional colors or more specific information with HOW the BYU Colors are used within your component, create this file.)
- fonts.md 
- breakpoints.md
