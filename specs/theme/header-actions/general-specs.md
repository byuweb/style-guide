# Header Actions Specifications
This action link should be used sparingly and for action items, not just for
a link that didn't fit in the menu.

It should be limited ideally to a single one-word link. In rare cases, you could
have two short one-word links (like 'Apply' and 'Defer') or a short two-word link
(like 'Title IX' or 'Request Aid').

Customization to these Header Actions are allowed, but is MUST meet accessibility guidelines. This means that levels of contrast must pass. See https://contrastchecker.com/ to test your color contrast. It is required to pass AA tests.
