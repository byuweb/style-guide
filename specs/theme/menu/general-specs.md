## Positioning of Links
When there are only 3 links or less, the links are left-aligned.
When there are more than 3 links, they take the full width of the Menu bar with each link taking the appropriate amount of space it needs (e.g., a link with a longer title will be wider than the other links).

## Number of Links
Only 6 links are allowed. If you have more than 6 menu links, the 6th link will 
become a MORE dropdown. The remaining links will be shown there.

## Required?
The menu is not required. But it is highly encouraged for accessibility and 
usability. There are a few cases where a menu is not neccessary (perhaps a single page site).

# Menu Specifications (Mobile Differences)
The Menu will change into a drop down menu from below the Header. A hamburger menu icon will appear on the right side.
The first line of the menu will always be Sign In/Out/My Account with their respective icons. Action button links to the left of the logged in user's first name will be added to the bottom of the mobile menu.
