# BYU Header Component

## The BYU Header contains the site's branding, navigation, and the search bar, as well as the logged-in user's account info.

With the exception of the byu.edu home page, all BYU-branded sites must use a header conforming to these guidelines.

## Usage

The header consists, at a minimum, of a navy blue (#002E5D) bar with the BYU logo and the site title. It may also include optional items such as a sub-title or supertitle, search bar, user info, navigation menu, and action links.

### Site Title

A one line title should be vertically centered on the BYU logo.

The title should be short enough that it doesn't wrap in desktop mode, but on mobile devices the title may wrap to two or three lines.

For a two-line title, the top and bottom of the text should align with the top and bottom of the BYU logo.

For a title with three or more lines, the top of the first line should align with the top of the BYU logo.
