# Header Actions Specifications

## Instructions
This action link should be used sparingly and for action items, not just for
a link that didn't fit in the menu.

It should be limited ideally to a single one-word link. In rare cases, you could
have two short one-word links (like 'Apply' and 'Defer') or a short two-word link
(like 'Title IX' or 'Request Aid').

## Button Styling
Styling this link as a button is allowed, but it MUST meet accessibility
guidelines. This mean that levels of contrast must pass.
See https://contrastchecker.com/ to test your color contrast. We need to pass
AA tests.
