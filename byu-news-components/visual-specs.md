# Visual Specs

All visual specs should be placed within the component project's main folder called 'visuals'.

## File Naming
All files should be specifically named with the topic of the visual.
For example: mobile-header.jpg or header-link-hover.jpg

## Updating Specs
If at all possible, specs should not be changed once they are in use or in implementation.
When this is required, the designer should replace the new spec visual (keeping the same file name)

In a rare case when there is a need to show the old spec (or temporarily leave the old spec for a specific reason), the old spec should be marked filename-old.date.png.

## Acceptable file types
Visuals should be in png or jpeg format.
They should not be uploaded in direct editable files like psd's.
