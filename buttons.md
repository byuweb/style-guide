# Button Styles

We know that Aleni has shown some do's and don't's for colored buttons. We'd like to document several guidelines.

## Color Pairings
All button color pairings should always be high contrast to pass AA standards. Please use the website https://contrastchecker.com/
to check if it passes. Also note that if you have small button text (less than 18px) there is a higher contrast required than larger font sizes.

## Border Radius
Border radius is something that can be decided per website, as it relates to how they use buttons in their content and site material.

## Hover Effects.
There are currently no guidelines on what hover effects are appropriate. Please make sure that color contrast is still accessible.
You may also use box shadows.
